<p>Hello, and thank you for your response!</p>

<p>We are an ensemble of people who play together because it's fun, and we sure want you to join us!</p>

<p>We usually meet every Thursday at 19:00 in the basement of the physics building at UiO. We then play for 2-ish hours. After rehearsals we usually hang out, talk and enjoy life. </p>

<p>We have a couple of instruments you can borrow if you don't have your own.</p>

<p>We begin our semester on Thursday the 1st of February a bit earlier than usual, at 18:30</p>

<p>We are hoping to see you at a rehearsal!</p>

<p>Regards,<br>Biørneblæs</p>
